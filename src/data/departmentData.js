      "The Role of the Worship Committee\
    The worship committee is responsible for:\
    •	 planning and designing each week’s \
    worship service\
    •	 providing a climate where members \
    experience the presence of God, feel loved, \
    accepted and enjoy being together\
    The Worship Program\
    No two Seventh-day Adventist churches \
    will necessarily have exactly the same \
    worship style or format. A Biblical focus in an \
    atmosphere of warmth, fellowship, care and \
    acceptance brings the church closer to Christ \
    and each other.\
    A successful worship service includes:\
    (1) preparing our hearts (2) hearing God speak; \
    (3) responding to God, and (4) being equipped \
    to share.\
    Elements such as the physical and spiritual \
    atmosphere, music, lyrics, words spoken, \
    congregational participation, drama and time \
    should be considered. It is important that \
    the committee agrees on the “variables” and \
    “constants” of church worship. This means that \
    the committee works together as a team.\
    A good worship committee will not continually \
    make changes for change’s sake but will always \
    be sensitive to the feelings and needs of all the \
    diverse groups among its membership.",

    department: "SABBATH SCHOOL",
    details:
      "In 1853, only a few years after the first group of Sabbath-keeping Adventists was formed in Washington, New Hampshire, James White organized the first regular Sabbath School in Rochester, New York. In 1852, estimating an informal membership of about 1,000 in the state of New York, White had written a series of 19 lessons appearing in the new Youth’s Instructor.\
\
    From its inception Sabbath School has focused on four emphases that are still prominent to this day: fellowship development, community outreach, Bible study, and foreign mission. A solid balance of these elements characterizes the most vital Sabbath Schools around the world.\
    \
    Based on these four emphases, from its beginning in 1853, Sabbath School membership has exploded from a handful of believers in upstate New York to an estimated 14 million today.\
    \
    “Sabbath School is one of the most important parts of Sabbath. It gives us the opportunity for fellowship, mission understanding, outreach and one of the greatest parts, Bible study and discussion. What a privilege to be able to study our Bible and the Adult Bible Study Guide in a small group setting and make the wonderful biblical instructions practical for our spiritual experience the next week. No one should miss Sabbath School!”—Ted N C Wilson, president, General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists.",
